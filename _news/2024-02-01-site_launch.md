Before everything, sorry about my english. I am not fluent at the language but I'm trying to learn forcing me to write all of this. The main reason is because it is a minimum requisite in almost all tech job positions, and is much more required in the game development industry. And will be cool for my to see my evolution after some time.

## What is the objective of this website?

I've created this website to share my journey through learning game development (and related skills) and I will be posting here whenever I have some time. (at the moment, I am finishing my undergraduation in Physics and a 'technologist degree' in Analysis and System Development).

I already shared some of my projects in the [Projects](https://marchinner.github.io/projects/) section and you will encounter (at this date) two java games that I've made from scratch after viewing some tutorials and reading some books/articles.

There is some others projects that has nothing to do with games but I made them for learn and put some knowledge in action. I (and my fellows) use some of these simple projects daily to simplify certain tasks at my job, and it helped a lot.

Another project is the [Orbital Energy Calculator](https://marchinner.github.io/projects/physics_orbital_energy/) that I made with my physic's professor as an result of my research in Orbital Mechanic's.

I have also write an scientific article talking about Nuclear Fusion and [published him](https://ocs.ifsp.edu.br/conict/xiconict/paper/view/6904) in my university congress.

## What I will be learning, at all?

With my current knowledge in C++ and Java, I've put my hands in engine development and started learning OpenGL, Shaders and game making with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). It was challenging and a pleasure, but I realised that if I really want to make a game (not in 10 years), publish it and get a job, I have to change the way I was learning. So, with this in mind I downloaded Unreal Engine 5 (because of C++) and started playing with it.

At the moment I am getting a overview of UE with the uDemy Course from [Stephen Ulibarri](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/) and he is great!
I've already learned the basics of the interface, the actors, components, blueprints and how to link them with C++ code at certaing circunstances.

So, my plan is to get a full overview of the engine and the tools, practice every day, make some small projects and after some time, start learning Blender to make my own models and texturing them with Quixel Mixer or other tool.

I've tried to do some pixel art but I oh my god.. I think that I dont have this style of art. 3D is more my thing.

## It will be difficult

With this in mind, I will keep studying and practicing every day and to help me journalying this, I made this website.

Ok, for now is it! I will be publishing some posts soon!

Thats all.
