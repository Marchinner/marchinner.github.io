<hr>

Witness my learning journey as I dive into the thrilling realm of game development in Java! This repository houses my second clone of a classic game, a creation born from scratch, fueled by my curiosity and a thirst for challenges.

Throughout this journey, I decided to take on the challenge of developing a fully functional game using only the official Java documentation as my guide. I explored every corner of Object-Oriented Programming and honed my programming logic skills, turning every obstacle into a learning opportunity.

Within this repository, you'll find the fruit of my effort and dedication, reflected in the game's source code. Every line is a tangible representation of my commitment to understanding fundamental concepts and applying them in a practical manner.

Join me on this journey of continuous learning, where each challenge overcome is a victory, and each line of code is a lesson learned. Feel free to explore, contribute, and perhaps find inspiration for your own projects.

Let's code together, explore together, and celebrate the power of learning through practice! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®
