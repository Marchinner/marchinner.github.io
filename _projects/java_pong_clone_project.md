<hr>

Behold, my inaugural masterpiece! I've crafted this game from scratch, without the crutch of tutorials or external assistance. My only companion on this creative journey has been the official Java Documentation. Why, you ask? Because my goal was not just to create a game, but to embark on a passionate odyssey of Java mastery and the enchanting realm of Game and Engine Development. My heart has found its true calling in this captivating pursuit.

I've encountered many difficulties during the process but with some analysis (and thankful by my past studies in Physics Graduation), I managed to success and I believe that I've learned much Game and Java development consepts.

I believe that with this project I learned most of the Object-oriented Programming concepts and now I can implement and develop much more complex software and games, wich will be my next's steps.
