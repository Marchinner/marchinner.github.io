Resuming the learning with my C++ uDemy course made by [Frank Mitropoulos](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/), I've finnaly arrived at introduction to references and pointers, learned about move and copy constructors and started the inheritance topic. An with this knowledgement, I finnaly understod why I was been failing with my last atempt to make a Pong clone with C++ and SFML. And now the project is created! It is on early stages but I'm making progress. You can check the project repository [here](https://github.com/Marchinner/cpPong). My main goal is to practice making some small projects using SFML or just C++.

I had my first contact with Blender and with some learning through YouTube videos, I managed to make my first model on my own, a bedside table. I had some issues exporting it to Unreal, but now (after some research) I've learned how to properly export and import it back into UE. It was so cool to make and see my model in-game and I even managed to make a blueprint that's opens the drawer when the player overlaps the collision box placed in front of the model. I am now managing to understand how to make certain actions with blueprints.

TODO: put a image of the drawer in blender and in the engine.

First, I've thought that it would be better to practice with the unreal and the starter content or others but, I feelt that I needed some of 'my models' and I know that doing this way the process will be much more time consuming but I think that I will enjoy much more this way, learning to create models my way and seeing it in-game will help me to put in practice the things I want to, the mechanics that I want to implement or learn, and this is a powerfull motivation for me. I like to learn as I need and see the result.

TODO: put a gif of the open/close mechanic of the drawer.

In this weekend I didn't spend too much time learning, I am passing through some problems with my job and I used this free time to rest my mind.. I will be back into learning on monday! And I will be making a 'learning path' or schedule to organize all the things.

That's all.
