Resuming the learning with my C++ uDemy course made by [Frank Mitropoulos](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/), I've finnaly arrived at introduction to references and pointers, learned about move and copy constructors and started the inheritance topic. An with this knowledgement, I finnaly understod why I was been failing with my last atempt to make a Pong clone with C++ and SFML. And now the project is created! It is on early stages but I'm making progress. You can check the project repository [here](https://github.com/Marchinner/cpPong).

I made my first contact with Blender and found some good youtube tutorials and I will try to make my first model, a beautiful donut. At first, I'm not going to spend much time learning 3D modeling, I only want an small overview of the program. I dont think that is time to do this, I have to focus on C++ programming and Unreal Engine for now.

I need to make a 'learning path' to follow and not feel lost while learning or practicing. My main focus will be get proficient with C++ (and good practices), get familiar with the engine and do some projects (clones and new ones).
